# 🎺📢 P2P Adspace | 🏗Scaffold-Eth 2 💎 Hackathon 🛠

## 🎥 The video walkthrough

coming soon...

## 📦 Our project
  
A peer-to-peer adspace marketplace.  
  
It's a new monetisation primitive for small sites. Consider it an alternative to  'buy me a coffee' or 'donate at this address'. With additial roles and protection mechanisms, we believe it could even be a Google Adwords alternative. 

## 💡 How it works

1. Website owner goes to the Marketplace to create a new adspace: https://adspace-marketplace.vercel.app/marketplace

2. The website owner copies the code snippet in their site.

This snippet is self-contained and can be plugged into any site (independent of the technology that was used to build it). 

3. Advertisers palce bids.  
  
A bid contains a creative (IPFS hash), an ad destination, an ad duration, an bid amount.

4. Website owner copies the accepts the ad they like most. 

5. The snippet starts displaying the ad and the countdown timer starts
