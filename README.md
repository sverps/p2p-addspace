P2P Addspace: A peer-to-peer adspace marketplace.  
  
Currently, it's a new monetisation primitive for small sites. Consider it an alternative to  'buy me a coffee' or 'donate at this address'.  

With additial protection mechanisms, it could be a Google Adwords alternative, but without a middleman who takes most of the revenue.

## How it works

1. Website owner goes to the Marketplace to create a new adspace: https://adspace-marketplace.vercel.app/marketplace

2. The website owner copies the code snippet in their site. (This snippet is self-contained and can be plugged into any site, independent of the technology that was used to build it.)

3. Advertisers place bids. (A bid contains a creative (IPFS hash), an ad destination, an ad duration, an bid amount.)

4. Website owner checks and accepts the ad they like most (and they receive the bid amount as payment). 

5. The snippet starts displaying the ad for the duration that was set.
